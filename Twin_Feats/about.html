        <h1>About Us</h1>
        <p>
            Twin brothers Kent & Kevin Smotherman founded TwinFeats Software in 1983 with a simple premise:
            Free software for a free world. From the beginnings on the Commodore 64 to today's Android apps, that
            vision has never wavered.

                petting the family cat, Solo (obviously), though he is not a Bond villain.
